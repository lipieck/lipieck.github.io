- title: Purchasing and Procurement internship - Shell, Krakow
  from: 2023
  to: 2023
  description: In this internship I mostly focused on building automation solutions for my team, the biggest achievement being an interactive VBA script that would attach itself to the SAP GUI and perform mundane tasks that had to cyclically be completed. 
                As an Intern I was tasked with filling this data in at the end of the week, however I found that this could be automated and proposed the VBA script solution to my management. In total it took around 4-5 hours to fill in this data each week and the script handled it all in less than an hour.
                All of this gave me a lot of insight into using SAP and building automations for it.
